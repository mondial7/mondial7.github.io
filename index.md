### 🧠 About Me

I'm a hands-on full-stack software engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable systems and leading product-dev teams. From Italy to Finland, Germany, and now the Netherlands — I've been on a European tour of code, learning, building, and mentoring along the way.

🔁 **XP & Agile advocate** — I love pair programming, TDD, and everything that supports a sustainable and psychologically safe dev environment.  

🛠️ **Pragmatic Engineer** — I value simplicity, clarity, and getting things done. While I'm at home with TypeScript, Python, Node.js, and React, I remain language- and tool-agnostic.

🔁 **Continuous Improvement Advocate** — I believe in evolving systems, teams, and myself through reflection, feedback, and iteration. Whether it's code quality, team health, or delivery flow, there's always room to grow.
